EAST HARLEM: THE LINK BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND FOSTER CARE

Adoption has always been a class issue. Those in poverty have less access to daycare, safe housing and are often at a higher risk for drug abuse. As a result, children are most often taken into the foster care system because of neglect or addiction. SNAP benefits provides funds for food to families and individuals in at low-to-no income levels. I'll then be looking at the correlation of SNAP benefits for households and children taken into foster care by community district in New York City. Afterwards, if we put the number of snap benefit households per foster child on a map, we'll notice that East Harlem sticks out like a sore thumb.

In evaluating what makes East Harlem unique from other community districts in New York, they rank number one in psychiatric hospitalizations and number 2 and three in drug and alcohol-related hospitalizations. Afterwards I'll briefly go into the poverty level of the area, with some anecdotal data about how that can contribute to higher states of mental health issues, which ultimtely can lead to other issues such as child neglect and drug abuse.
